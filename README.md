*** This project works with `NER (Named Entity Recognition)` in `German`. 

de_train.json and de_dev.json are the annoted data. And I will try every NLP tools to detect Named Entity in German.

First I have used [Spacy German Model](https://spacy.io/models/de). 

There are two language models trained in Spacy. And I will try each of them.

`The result`

`model 1`
* Precision：45.785664%
- Recall: 63.401229%
* F-Call: 53.172451ù

`model 2`
* Precision: 41.127470%	
- Recall: 67.290016%	
* F-Call: 51.052062%
